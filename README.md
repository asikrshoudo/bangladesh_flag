# Bangladesh Flag Animation with Python Turtle

A simple yet beautiful Python project that uses the `turtle` graphics library to draw the National Flag of Bangladesh. The scene includes a yellow sun, a green ground with grass, and an animation of clouds moving across a blue sky.

## Features
* **Official Flag Ratio:** The flag is drawn following the 10:6 length-to-breadth ratio with the red circle slightly shifted toward the hoist (left side) as per official specs.
* **Dynamic Sky:** Realistic blue sky background with three clouds that continuously move from left to right.
* **Landscape Details:** Includes a pole with a golden knob, a yellow sun with rays, and a green ground with randomly generated grass blades.
* **Smooth Animation:** Uses `screen.tracer(0)` and `screen.update()` for a flicker-free experience.
